# General information
This page is used to inform you regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information in our Android apps.

If you choose to use our apps, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that we collect is used for providing and improving the apps. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

# Information collection and use
When using our apps, through the use of third-party services provided by Google we may use and collect certain personally identifiable information about you, depending on your device settings and your consent. General information about how Google's products use data may be found under the following link:
* [https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites)

The third-party services we use, their purpose within the app and the information which is collected through these services are described in the following:
#### AdMob
Our apps use AdMob, Googles Mobile Advertising platform, to display ads in the basic (free) version. Depending on your Google account settings, AdMob may collect and use personally identifiable information to serve personalized ads, i.e.
* online identifiers, including Android IDs, cookies and unique device identifiers for advertising (Google Advertiser ID, unique Advertising ID, IDFVs/Android IDs and similar)
* IP addresses
* device identifiers
* client identifiers 
* location data
* usage data

You may choose to generally opt-out of personal advertising for your Google account by visiting [https://www.google.com/settings/ads](https://www.google.com/settings/ads). Please be aware that some of the information listed above may still be used also for non-personalized ads, e.g. to prevent and detect fraud. Further details about which data Google uses to serve ads may be found under the following link:

#### Firebase Analytics / Firebase Crashlytics / Firebase Performance Monitoring
Our apps use Google Firebase Analytics, Firebase Crashlytics and Firebase Performance Monitoring to gain insights about how the apps are used and how we may improve them to enhance the user experience. Information collected by Firebase may also be used to improve the performance of our apps, for example to reduce the time until search results are available. Analytics, Crashlytics and Performance Monitoring may collect and use personally identifiable information, i.e.
* online identifiers, including Android IDs, cookies and unique device identifiers for advertising (Google Advertiser ID, unique Advertising ID, IDFVs/Android IDs and similar)
* IP addresses
* Firebase installation IDs
* Analytics App Instance IDs

# Permissions used by our apps

Any transfer of location information is encrypted and no further personal information is included in the search queries.
