# General information
This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use our Android apps.

If you choose to use our apps, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that we collect is used for providing and improving the apps. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

# Information Collection and Use
For a better experience, while using our apps, we may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to your current location. The information that we request will be retained by us and used as described in this privacy policy.

User Location: If (and only if) you grant the app permission to access your current location, this location is constantly queried while using the app. Data obtained regarding your location is only used to query for search results near your location (which is the main purpose of the app) and to display your location and the serach results within the app, e.g. on a map. Any transfer of location information is encrypted and no further personal information is included in the search queries.
The app does use third party services that may collect information used to identify you.

The app does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third party code and libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services.

# Security
We value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it.
