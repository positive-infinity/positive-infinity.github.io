# Frequently Asked Questions

## Where can I see photos for locations and how can I add or improve pictures by myself?
Photos of locations are generally available in the Details view (single click on a list item or long-press an item and select Details). In the Details view choose the Images tab to view pictures for the current location. Please be aware that images may not be available for all locations but you can add your own (see below). Typically, the street-level images used in our apps are part of a sequence, i.e. you may use the shown arrows to navigate forward or backward to even improve the sight.

If images for a location are not yet available or you'd like to improve the current imagery, you can do so at any time. Our apps use [Mapillary](https://www.mapillary.com/), an open data street-level imagery platform to which anybody can contribute. To add images, just download the [Mapillary Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mapillary.app) which makes it easy to capture and upload images. As soon as the images have been processed on the Mapillary servers they will also be available to be show within our apps.

## What do the wheelchair symbols mean?
Wheelchair accessibility information is availabe for some apps, e.g. in our toilet finder app. There are three stages of accessibility to indicate if a particular location is suitable to be used with a wheelchair (or similar mobility devices):

![alt text](../assets/wheelchair_yes.png) Wheelchairs have full unrestricted access, i.e. the entry and the rooms are stepless.<br/>
![alt text](../assets/wheelchair_limited.png) Wheelchairs have partial access, i.e. the entry may have a step not higher than the width of a hand and the most important rooms should be accessible.<br/>
![alt text](../assets/wheelchair_no.png) Wheelchairs have no unrestricted access, i.e. the location might be accessible by stairs only.<br>

## What do the colored fuel prices mean?
Fuel prices are currently shwon only in Germany. For a quick overview, the prices are colored based on their value: The cheapest third is colored in green, the middle third is colored in orange and the most expensive third is colored in red. Additionally, the cheapest price is marked in bold.

For example, if the minumun fuel price for E5 is 1,60€ and the maximum price is 1,90€, then prices between 1,60€ and 1,70€ are marked green, prices between 1,70€ and 1,80€ are marked orange and prices between 1,80€ and 1,90€ are marked red. 
## Can I switch over from the legacy Cash Group PRO app to the up-to-date version of the app
Yes. Historically, there are two Cash Group apps: the legacy one (a paid app for which you needed to pay on install time) and the current one (with in-app billing). The paid legacy Cash Group App is not updated anymore. However, if you own the legacy app you may simply download and install the current one, purchase the PRO features and get the price refunded. To do so, just search for "Cash Group Geldautomaten" in Google Play, download the app, purchase the PRO features using in-app billing and after that send us the purchase ID so we can refund your purchase.

## In which countries do the apps work?
The apps work anywhere in the world. There are two exceptions: Cash Group Locator and Cash Pool Locator do show results in Germany only as the corresponding banking groups are based in Germany.

## Is it possible to report erronous or missing places?
Of course! Many users constantly help to improve the databases by reporting newly added or closed locations from all over the world. Therefore, the data used by the apps is up-to-date and gets improved continuously. There are mainly two ways to report updates:

Report a missing place: Choose "Report mising entry" from the overflow menu (the three dots at the upper right corner) in the main list or map view. Please describe the location of the missing place as exact as possible (or even better add the GPS coordinates, e.g. from Google Maps).
Report an errornous place: Long-press the corresponding list item and choose "Report errornous entry" from the appearing context menu. Please describe the type of error as exact as possible, e.g. "wrong address", "place not existing / closed", "wrong opening hours" and so on.
After you sent your feedback, we will correct the databases as soon as possible. You will be notified by email as soon as the update is live. Remark: The reporting functionality is currently being redesigned to make it easier for you to send updates directly from within the app. Stay tuned for one of the next app updates to try it out!

## How can I search via the map?
Besides searching by place or address via the automcomplete search field it is also possible to search directly from the map. To do so, switch to the map view, position the map anywhere you'd like to search and select "Search here" from the main menu (three dot overflow).

## Is it possible to donate?
Yes, since some users asked for the possibility to donate money independently of PRO version purchases, we added a donate button to the bottom of this page. The money obtained from donations is solely spent to cover fix costs (like servers, co-working rent and so on) and helps us very much to keep everything going and actively push further development. We really appriciate your support! If you have any questions regarding donations, do not hesitate to contacting us.
